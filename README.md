2.  When prompted, **enter your guess** (a number from 1 to 100).
3.  The game will give you a hint:
    - `Guess a larger number.`
    - `Guess a smaller number.`
4.  Use these clues to refine your strategy and make your next guess.
5.  Continue until you guess the correct number. The game will celebrate your success and show you how many steps it took to find your inner peace!

---

### ## ðŸ”§ Get Started

Ready to test your intuition? You'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

1.  Save the code as `GuessingGame.java`.
2.  Open your terminal and navigate to the file's location.
3.  Compile the code with this command:
    ```bash
    javac GuessingGame.java
    ```
4.  Run the game:
    ```bash
    java GuessingGame
    ```
